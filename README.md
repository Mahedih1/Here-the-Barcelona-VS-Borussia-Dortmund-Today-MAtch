# Here-the-Barcelona-VS-Borussia-Dortmund-Today-MAtch


​Today, it is April 14, 2025, and Borussia Dortmund and FC Barcelona have no longer met in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final draw. On April 9, 2025, Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, Barcelona - Barcelona 4 - 0 Borussia Dortmund ​
The second leg is set for April 15, 2025, at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. The aggregate score is 4-0 in Barcelona's favor, therefore, Dortmund need to overturn the deficit to progress. ​
Here are some key developments leading up to the second leg:
Injuries: The central defender Nico Schlotterbeck of Borussia Dortmund will miss the rest of the season with a torn meniscus, a blow to Dortmund’s back line. Meanwhile, on the opposite side, Alejandro Balde's hamstring injury is likely to keep the left-back out for at least three weeks — a blow to Barcelona and potentially for another game or two in this tie with the Championship outfit. ​
Suspension Watch: Barcelona’s Iñigo Martínez is one yellow card away from a suspension that would keep him out of the semi-finals. This disciplinary issue could impact his minutes in the next game. ​
